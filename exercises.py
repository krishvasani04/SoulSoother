    To reframe your thought, my beautiful Boopie, consider:
    
    1. Is this thought a bit like trypophobia - an irrational fear we both understand?
    2. What would you say if I was having this thought? (I know you'd be kinder than you are to yourself)
    3. Imagine we're looking at the Eiffel Tower from our dream balcony - how would this thought look from there?
    4. Focus on what you can control - like how you make that amazing pasta!
    5. Just like we don't know if our future husky will be well-behaved, we can't predict the worst outcome
    
    Your reframed thought should feel as good as Kinder Joy tastes! And remember, your Bean loves you no matter what.
